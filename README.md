# PeerReviewApp

## Important Information:
This is my side project. Since I haven't purchased an Apple Developer Program membership, you'll need to run terminal commands to open the app.

I do not store any of your data or API keys.

All related data is stored locally in `~/Library/Application Support/com.PeerReview.app`.
